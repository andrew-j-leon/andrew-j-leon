# Hi, I'm Andrew Leon
I'm a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine with a major in Software Engineering.

I am familiar with all aspects of the software development life cycle, from collecting requirements to iteratively designing and implementing software systems. For my Senior Design Project, I collaborated with a team of peers to create the front end of a web app which would enable UCI's graduate division to manage the remissions and fellowships of all UCI graduate students.

I have used JavaScript, Python, Java, and PHP to make various front end, back end, and desktop applications, both for my studies and personal projects.

# Purpose of this GitHub

This GitHub is intended to show prospective employers code examples from projects I've written in my free time.
